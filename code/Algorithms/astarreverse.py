#
# This file contains the astar reverse algorithm. This algorithm first completes a random algorithm
# of the case, so that a solution exists within the memory. Once the random solution is generated,
# the start-state and the solution will work towards each other based upon a lowest F-value. This
# means both sides create children. The F-value is calculated using the factors G and H. 
# G is the amount of moves that has been made. H is the similarity of the two boards. Once the two
# boards match, the algorithm stops, because that means a path to the solution can be made. 
# The algorithm also stops if the red car has a free path towards the end, because a solution is
# then found.
