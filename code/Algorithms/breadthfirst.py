#
# This is a breadthfirst algorithm. This means that it looks at all movements which can be made from
# the starting position and making children per layer. The algorithm first completes one layer of 
# children before continuing onto the next layer, which has more children. This algorithm will give
# the fastest solution possible, but it is extremely memory intensive, due to the amount of states 
# it has to account for.
